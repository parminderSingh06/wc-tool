Build Your Own wc Tool

This challenge is to build your own version of the Unix command line tool wc!

The Unix command line tools are a great metaphor for good software engineering and they follow the Unix Philosophies of:

    Writing simple parts connected by clean interfaces - each tool does just one thing and provides a simple CLI that handles text input from either files or file streams.
    Design programs to be connected to other programs - each tool can be easily connected to other tools to create incredibly powerful compositions.
